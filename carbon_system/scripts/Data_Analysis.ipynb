    "# Carbon System Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to analyze the performance of the Sunburst Sensors, LLC. SAMI-pH (PHSEN) pH and SAMI-pCO$_{2}$ seawater measurements, and the Pro-Oceanus pCO2 sensor measurements at the Pioneer Coastal Array and Global Irminger Array. This is done on a deployment-by-deployment, site-by-site comparison with the pH measurements from discete water samples collected by Niskin Bottle casts during deployment and recovery of the instrumentation during mooring maintainence. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "There are three main sources of data sources:\n",
    "* **Deployments**: These are the deployment master sheets from OOI Asset Management. They contain the deployment numbers, deployment start times and cruise, and recovery times and cruise, for all of the instrumentation deployed. \n",
    "* **PHSEN**: This is the Sunburst Sensors, LLC. SAMI-pH sensor. It is calibrated for pH values from 70-9.0 pH units for salinities from 25-40 psu. Manufacturers stated accuracy of 0.003 pH units, precision < 0.001 pH units, and long-term drift of < 0.001 pH units / 6 months. The data is downloaded from the Ocean Observatories data portal (OOINet) as netCDF files.\n",
    "* **PCO2W**: This is the Sunburst Sensors, LLC. SAMI-CO<sub>2</sub> sensor. It is calibrated for pCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from 200 - 1000 ppm. Manufacturers stated accuracy of 3 ppm, precision < 1 ppm, and long-term drift of < 1 ppm / 6 months. The data is downloaded from the Ocean Observatories data portal (OOINet) as netCDF files.\n",
    "* **CTDBP**: This is the collocated SeaBird CTD with the PHSEN. The data is downloaded from the Ocean Observatories data portal (OOINet) as netCDF files. These data are needed since the PCO2W datasets do not contain either temperature (T), salinity (S), pressure (P), or density ($\\rho$) data needed to compare with the discrete sampling.\n",
    "* **Discrete Water Samples**: These are discrete water samples collected via Niskin Bottle casts during deployment and recovery of the moored instrumentation. The data is downloaded from OOI Alfresco website as excel files. Parameters sampled include oxygen, salinity, nutrient concentrations (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, silicate), chlorophyll concentrations, and the carbon system. The carbon system parameters sampled are Total Alkalinity (TA), Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), and pH. \n",
    "---\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "#### PCO2W Processing\n",
    "Verifying the in-situ pCO<sub>2</sub> measured by the PCO2W against the pCO<sub>2</sub> calculated from the discrete water samples TA and DIC requires several preprocessing steps of the PCO2W datasets. First, the netCDF datasets are opened using ```xarray``` into an xarray ```dataset``` object and the primary dimension set to 'time'. Next, T, S, P, and $\\rho$ are interpolated to the PCO2W time base using xarray ```ds.interp_like``` from the dataset from the collocated CTDBP. Next, the pCO2 is corrected for hydrostatic pressure using a correction of 15% per 1000 dbar pressure (Enns 1965, Reed et al. 2018). Then the first and last four days of PCO2W data are selected. The standard deviation of the selected pCO2 is calculated using the first-order differencing with a time-lag of one, in order to arrive at a quasi-stationary time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CTDBP Processing\n",
    "The associated CTD datasets to the PCO2W are opened using ```xarray``` into an xarray ```dataset``` object and the primary dimension set to 'time'. The CTD dataset T, S, P, and $\\rho$ are interpolated to the PCO2W time base and merged into the PCO2W dataset using ```ds.interp_like```. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete Water Samples Processing\n",
    "The relevant deployment and recovery cruise data for comparison with the PCO2W dataset(s) are opened and loaded into a pandas ```DataFrame``` object. Next, the pCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are calculated using the ```CO2SYS``` package from the associated TA and DIC concentrations. The bottle samples are then filtered by cruise, time, and depth to identify the samples associated with the deployment and recovery of the PCO2W dataset being analyzed."
